## Core Case Study: Tropical Rain Forests Are Disappearing

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Cover only 7% of the earth’s surface, but can contain up to half of the world’s terrestrial plant and animal species

-   To date, human activities have destroyed or degraded more than half of the earth's tropical rain forests

    -   logging, crop development, cattle grazing, and encroaching civilization

-   Why should you be concerned about the disappearance of tropical rain forests?

## Core Case Study: Tropical Rain Forests Are Disappearing

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Effect 1 - [Biodiversity Loss]{.keyword}**

-   Clearing these forests causes the extinction of many of their plant and animal species

<!-- -->

-   Loss of key species in these forests can have a ripple effect that leads to the extinction of other species that they help support

**Effect 2 - [Climate Change]{.keyword}**

-   Warms the atmosphere and speeds up climate change.

-   Fewer plants using photosynthesis to remove human-generated emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2)

-   Resulting increased levels of CO2 in the atmosphere contributes to atmospheric warming and climate change,

Effect 3 - [System Change]{.keyword} and [Tipping Point]{.keyword}

-   Large-scale losses of tropical rain forests can change regional weather pattern in ways that can prevent the forest from returning in cleared or degraded areas.

-   When this irreversible ecological [tipping point]{.keyword} is reached, the tropical rain forests in such areas become drier and less-diverse tropical grasslands

## Earth’s Life-Support System Has Four Major Components

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Earth’s life-support system has four spherical components that interact with each other.

-   Life is sustained by the cycling of nutrients and energy between and through these systems.

-   [Atmosphere]{.keyword}: composed of the troposphere and the stratosphere.

-   [Hydrosphere]{.keyword}: water at or near the earth’s surface (ice, water, and water vapor).

-   [Geosphere]{.keyword}: composed of a hot core, a thick, mostly rocky mantle, and a thin outer crust.

-   [Biosphere]{.keyword}: wherever life is found within the other three spheres.

## Three Factors Sustain the Earth’s Life

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   The one-way flow of high-quality energy Solar energy principle of sustainability Greenhouse effect

-   The cycling of nutrients Chemical cycling principle of sustainability

-   Gravity

Greenhouse Earth. High-quality solar energy flows from the sun to the earth. It is degraded to lower-quality energy (mostly heat) as it interacts with the earth's air, water, soil, and life forms, and eventually some of it returns to space.

Certain gases in the earth's atmosphere retain enough of the sun's incoming energy as heat to warm the planet in what is known as the greenhouse effect.

## Major Components of an Ecosystem

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
[Ecology]{.keyword}

-   Organisms interact with each other and with their nonliving environment

-   Biotic (living) and abiotic (nonliving) parts of the environment exhibit sequential levels of organization Five of these levels: organisms, populations, communities, ecosystems, and the biosphere

## Major Components of an Ecosystem

-   Ecologists assign each organism in an ecosystem to a feeding level, or [trophic level]{.keyword}, depending on its source of nutrients.

-   Organisms are classified as producers and consumers based on whether they make (produce) or find (consume) food.

-   [Producers]{.keyword} Capture energy and make their own food from inorganic materials in the environment

-   [Consumers]{.keyword} Eat other organisms or their remains

-   [Detritivores]{.keyword} Consumers that feed on small bits of organic material (detritus)

-   [Decomposers]{.keyword} Consumers that feed on remains and break them into their inorganic building blocks

## Major Components of an Ecosystem

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
[Producers]{.keyword}

-   Organisms, such as green plants, that make the nutrients they need from compounds and energy obtained from their environment.

[Photosynthesis]{.keyword}

-   Plants capture solar energy that falls on their leaves and use it to combine carbon dioxide and water to form carbohydrates, such as glucose (C~6~H~12~0~6~), which they store as a source of the chemical energy.

-   In the process, they emit oxygen (0~2~) gas into the atmosphere. Oxygen keeps us and most other animal species alive.
