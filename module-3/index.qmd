## Core Case Study: Tropical Rain Forests Are Disappearing

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Cover only 7% of the earth’s surface, but can contain up to half of the world’s terrestrial plant and animal species

-   To date, human activities have destroyed or degraded more than half of the earth's tropical rain forests

    -   logging, crop development, cattle grazing, and encroaching civilization

-   Why should you be concerned about the disappearance of tropical rain forests?

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Earth’s life-support system has four spherical components that interact with each other.

-   Life is sustained by the cycling of nutrients and energy between and through these systems.

-   [Atmosphere]{.keyword}: composed of the troposphere and the stratosphere.

-   [Hydrosphere]{.keyword}: water at or near the earth’s surface (ice, water, and water vapor).

-   [Geosphere]{.keyword}: composed of a hot core, a thick, mostly rocky mantle, and a thin outer crust.

-   [Biosphere]{.keyword}: wherever life is found within the other three spheres.

Greenhouse Earth. High-quality solar energy flows from the sun to the earth. It is degraded to lower-quality energy (mostly heat) as it interacts with the earth's air, water, soil, and life forms, and eventually some of it returns to space.

Certain gases in the earth's atmosphere retain enough of the sun's incoming energy as heat to warm the planet in what is known as the greenhouse effect.

## Trophic Structure: Who Eats Whom in an Ecosystem

-   Ecologists describe the flow of energy and matter in ecosystems using [trophic levels]{.keyword}, which group organisms based on how they obtain nutrients and energy.

    Organisms fall into a small number of functional roles:

    -   [Producers]{.keyword}: Capture energy (usually sunlight) and manufacture organic molecules from inorganic materials such as carbon dioxide, water, and nutrients.
    -   [Consumers]{.keyword}: Obtain energy by eating producers, other consumers, or organic remains.
    -   [Detritivores]{.keyword}: Consumers that feed on detritus—small fragments of dead organisms and organic waste.
    -   [Decomposers]{.keyword}: Specialized consumers (primarily bacteria and fungi) that chemically break down organic matter into inorganic nutrients, returning them to the environment for reuse by producers.

    Together, these groups define how energy enters ecosystems and how nutrients are recycled through living and nonliving components.

## Producers: The Entry Point of Energy into Ecosystems

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
[Producers]{.keyword}

-   organisms (plants, algae, and some bacteria)
-   manufacture the organic nutrients they need using energy and inorganic materials from their environment

[Photosynthesis]{.keyword}

-   Producers capture solar energy and use it

-   Convert carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O) into carbohydrates such as glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆), which store chemical energy

-   Oxygen (O₂) released as a byproduct of this process accumulates in the atmosphere, **making aerobic life possible** for most organisms
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

:::
:::::

## Consumers: Obtaining Energy from Other Organisms

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
[Consumers]{.keyword}

-   Cannot produce their own food
-   Obtain energy and nutrients by feeding on producers, other consumers, or the wastes and remains of organisms

Several major consumer types are commonly recognized:

-   [Primary consumers (herbivores)]{.keyword}: Animals that feed primarily on plants or algae
-   [Carnivores]{.keyword}: Animals that obtain energy by feeding on the tissues of other animals
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

:::
:::::

## Decomposers: Recycling Matter in Ecosystems

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
[Decomposers]{.keyword} are consumers that obtain energy and nutrients by breaking down the wastes and remains of plants and animals.

They are a subset of **heterotrophs** and are primarily bacteria and fungi.

Through decomposition, these organisms convert organic matter into inorganic nutrients that are returned to the soil, water, and air, where they can be reused by producers.

:::
:::::

## Detritivores: Breaking Down Organic Matter

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
[Detritivores]{.keyword} obtain energy and nutrients by feeding directly on detritus—the wastes and dead bodies of other organisms.

By physically fragmenting organic material, detritivores help convert large, complex remains (such as fallen tree trunks) into simpler forms that can be further decomposed into inorganic nutrients usable by plants.

In natural ecosystems, wastes and dead organisms are not discarded; they function as resources that support nutrient cycling, consistent with the chemical cycling principle of sustainability.

:::
:::::

## Cellular Respiration: Releasing Stored Chemical Energy

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Producers, consumers, and decomposers all rely on [cellular respiration]{.keyword} to release the chemical energy stored in glucose and other organic compounds.

In most organisms, this occurs through **aerobic respiration**, which uses oxygen to convert glucose back into carbon dioxide and water, releasing energy that fuels growth, maintenance, and reproduction.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![Aerobic cellular respiration, showing glucose and oxygen being converted into carbon dioxide, water, and usable chemical energy. From Wikimedia Commons, a freely licensed media file repository.](images/respiration.png){fig-alt="Diagram illustrating aerobic respiration with glucose and oxygen as inputs and carbon dioxide, water, and ATP energy as outputs."}
:::
:::::

## Anaerobic Respiration: Energy without Oxygen

Some decomposers, including yeast and certain bacteria, obtain energy by breaking down glucose and other organic compounds **in the absence of oxygen**.

This process is known as [anaerobic respiration]{.keyword}, or **fermentation**.

Rather than producing carbon dioxide and water, anaerobic respiration generates a variety of end products, depending on the organism and pathway involved, including:

-   methane gas (CH₄)
-   ethyl alcohol (C₂H₆O)
-   acetic acid (C₂H₄O₂), the main component of vinegar
-   hydrogen sulfide (H₂S), a toxic gas with a characteristic rotten-egg odor

All organisms obtain energy through aerobic or anaerobic respiration, but **only producers (plants, algae, and some bacteria) carry out photosynthesis**.

## Energy Flow and Nutrient Cycling Sustain Ecosystems

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Ecosystems—and the biosphere as a whole—are sustained by two fundamental processes:

-   **One-way energy flow**: Energy enters ecosystems as sunlight, is captured by producers, transferred through trophic levels, and is ultimately lost as heat.
-   **Nutrient cycling**: Matter such as carbon, nitrogen, and water is continuously recycled between organisms and the physical environment.

Together, these processes reflect two core scientific principles of sustainability: energy flows through ecosystems, while nutrients cycle within them.

## Soil: The Foundation of Life on Land

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Soil is a complex, living system composed of:

-   rock fragments and mineral particles
-   essential mineral nutrients
-   decaying organic matter
-   water, air, and a diverse community of organisms

Soil is one of Earth’s most important forms of **natural capital**.

Although it is technically renewable, soil forms extremely slowly, making the protection and renewal of **topsoil** critical for long-term sustainability.

-   **Major horizons in a mature soil:**
    -   **O** – organic layer (leaf litter)
    -   **A** – topsoil

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Most plant roots and the majority of soil organic matter are concentrated in:
    -   the **O horizon** (leaf litter)
    -   the **A horizon** (topsoil)
-   These layers support dense communities of: bacteria, fungi, earthworms, insects and other soil invertebrates
-   Through feeding and decomposition, soil organisms:
    -   break down complex organic compounds
    -   produce [humus]{.keyword}, a stable mixture of partially decomposed plant and animal material
        -   Improves soil structure, nutrient availability, and water retention, supporting plant growth and ecosystem productivity.

-   At each transfer, organisms use most of the energy for:
    -   metabolism
    -   movement

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Energy availability decreases at higher trophic levels.
-   With each transfer, much energy is lost as **heat** through respiration.
-   Because energy diminishes at each step:
    -   Food chains are short.

-   **Energy flows**:
    -   Enters as sunlight
    -   Moves through trophic levels
    -   Is lost as heat
    -   Does **not** get recycled
-   **Nutrients cycle**:

-   **Net primary productivity (NPP)** differs dramatically across terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.

-   Ecosystems with warm temperatures, ample sunlight, and sufficient water (e.g., tropical rainforests, swamps, marshes, coral reefs) tend to have high NPP.

-   Deserts, tundra, and open ocean regions generally have low NPP per unit area.

-   Although the **open ocean** has low NPP per square meter, its enormous area makes it a major contributor to global primary production.

-   Only energy stored as **NPP** (not GPP) is available to support consumers and higher trophic levels.

-   These pathways are called [biogeochemical cycles]{.keyword}.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Biogeochemical cycles are driven by:

-   Solar energy

-   Gravity

-   Biological processes

Human activities now alter these cycles at global scales.
:::
:::::

## The Water Cycle: Movement of Water Through Earth Systems

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
The **hydrologic cycle** moves water continuously among the atmosphere, land, and oceans.

### Key processes

-   **Evaporation** – Solar energy converts liquid water to vapor.
-   **Transpiration** – Plants release water vapor to the atmosphere.
-   **Condensation** – Water vapor cools and forms clouds.
-   **Precipitation** – Water returns to Earth as rain, snow, or ice.
-   **Runoff and infiltration** – Water flows over land or enters soil.
-   **Groundwater storage and discharge** – Water is stored in aquifers and slowly returns to surface waters.

Although water is continuously recycled, **only a small fraction is accessible freshwater**; most is in oceans, ice, or deep underground.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/clipboard-4215324875.png)
:::
:::::

## Human Impacts on the Water Cycle

Human activities alter both the quantity and movement of water:

-   **Freshwater withdrawal** faster than natural recharge
-   **Urbanization** that reduces infiltration and increases runoff
-   **Deforestation** that lowers transpiration
-   **Wetland drainage** that disrupts natural water storage and filtration

Changes to the water cycle affect water availability, water quality, and ecosystem stability.

## The Carbon Cycle: Movement of Carbon Through Earth Systems

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Carbon cycles among the atmosphere, biosphere, oceans, and geosphere.

### Major biological processes

-   **Photosynthesis** – Producers remove CO₂ from the atmosphere and convert it into organic carbon.
-   **Respiration** – Producers, consumers, and decomposers return CO₂ to the atmosphere.
-   **Decomposition** – Breaks down organic matter, releasing carbon back to air or soil.
-   **Long-term storage** – Carbon can be stored in oceans, soils, sediments, and fossil fuels.

Atmospheric CO₂ is a greenhouse gas and plays a central role in regulating Earth’s climate.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/clipboard-122124513.png)

## Human Impacts on the Carbon Cycle

Human activities are increasing atmospheric CO₂ by:

-   **Burning fossil fuels** faster than they form
-   **Deforestation**, reducing carbon uptake by plants

These changes shift the balance of the carbon cycle and contribute to climate change.

## The Nitrogen Cycle: Transformations Driven by Microbes

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Nitrogen is essential for proteins and DNA, but most organisms cannot use atmospheric nitrogen (N₂) directly.

### Key processes

-   **Nitrogen fixation** – Specialized bacteria convert N₂ into ammonia (NH₄⁺).
-   **Nitrification** – Bacteria convert:
    -   NH₄⁺ → NO₂⁻ → NO₃⁻
-   **Assimilation** – Plants take up NH₄⁺ or NO₃⁻ and incorporate nitrogen into organic molecules.
-   **Consumption** – Animals obtain nitrogen by eating plants or other animals.
-   **Decomposition and denitrification** – Decomposers return nitrogen to the soil, and some bacteria convert it back to N₂ gas.

Microorganisms drive most nitrogen transformations.

## Human Impacts on the Nitrogen Cycle

Humans have greatly accelerated nitrogen movement through ecosystems by:

-   **Industrial fertilizer production** (fixing atmospheric N₂ at large scales)
-   **Fossil fuel combustion**, releasing nitrogen oxides (NOₓ)
-   **Agricultural runoff**, increasing nitrate in waterways

Consequences include:

-   Eutrophication and algal blooms
-   Oxygen depletion in aquatic systems
-   Acid rain formation

## Acid Rain

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
[Acid rain]{.keyword} forms when **sulfur dioxide (SO₂)** and **nitrogen oxides (NOₓ)** are released into the atmosphere and react with water vapor to form sulfuric and nitric acids.

These acids return to Earth through precipitation (rain, snow, sleet, or dry deposition).

Impacts include:

-   Increased soil acidity
-   Leaching of essential nutrients
-   Altered chemistry of lakes and streams
-   Harm to aquatic organisms and forests

Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for DNA, ATP, and cell membranes.

Unlike carbon and nitrogen, phosphorus: - **Does not have a major atmospheric phase** - Cycles primarily through **rocks, soils, water, and living organisms**

Key processes

-   **Weathering** releases phosphate (PO₄³⁻) from rocks.
-   **Plant uptake** incorporates phosphorus into organic molecules.
-   **Consumption and decomposition** return phosphorus to soils and sediments.
-   Some phosphorus is transported to oceans and can become buried in marine sediments, removing it from short-term cycling.

## Human Impacts on the Phosphorus Cycle

Humans accelerate phosphorus movement by:

-   **Mining phosphate rock** to produce fertilizers
-   **Deforestation**, which reduces phosphorus retained in topsoil

## Why Ecosystem Monitoring Matters

Understanding ecosystem health requires:

-   Long-term baseline data
-   Global assessments
-   Integration across climate, biodiversity, and nutrient cycles

Scientific monitoring helps us:

-   Detect ecosystem degradation
-   Develop management strategies
-   Identify ecological tipping points
-   Avoid crossing planetary boundaries

## Ecosystems: Key Takeaways

-   Energy flows through ecosystems.
-   Matter cycles within ecosystems.
-   Producers, consumers, and decomposers structure energy flow and nutrient cycling.
-   Human activities now alter ecosystem processes at local and global scales.

Ecosystem sustainability depends on maintaining both energy flow and nutrient cycling.
