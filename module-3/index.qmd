## Core Case Study: Tropical Rain Forests Are Disappearing

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Cover only 7% of the earth’s surface, but can contain up to half of the world’s terrestrial plant and animal species

-   To date, human activities have destroyed or degraded more than half of the earth's tropical rain forests

    -   logging, crop development, cattle grazing, and encroaching civilization

-   Why should you be concerned about the disappearance of tropical rain forests?

## Earth’s Life-Support System Has Four Major Components

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Earth’s life-support system has four spherical components that interact with each other.

-   Life is sustained by the cycling of nutrients and energy between and through these systems.

-   [Atmosphere]{.keyword}: composed of the troposphere and the stratosphere.

-   [Hydrosphere]{.keyword}: water at or near the earth’s surface (ice, water, and water vapor).

-   [Geosphere]{.keyword}: composed of a hot core, a thick, mostly rocky mantle, and a thin outer crust.

-   [Biosphere]{.keyword}: wherever life is found within the other three spheres.

Greenhouse Earth. High-quality solar energy flows from the sun to the earth. It is degraded to lower-quality energy (mostly heat) as it interacts with the earth's air, water, soil, and life forms, and eventually some of it returns to space.

Certain gases in the earth's atmosphere retain enough of the sun's incoming energy as heat to warm the planet in what is known as the greenhouse effect.

## Trophic Structure: Who Eats Whom in an Ecosystem

-   Ecologists describe the flow of energy and matter in ecosystems using [trophic levels]{.keyword}, which group organisms based on how they obtain nutrients and energy.

    Organisms fall into a small number of functional roles:

    -   [Producers]{.keyword}: Capture energy (usually sunlight) and manufacture organic molecules from inorganic materials such as carbon dioxide, water, and nutrients.
    -   [Consumers]{.keyword}: Obtain energy by eating producers, other consumers, or organic remains.
    -   [Detritivores]{.keyword}: Consumers that feed on detritus—small fragments of dead organisms and organic waste.
    -   [Decomposers]{.keyword}: Specialized consumers (primarily bacteria and fungi) that chemically break down organic matter into inorganic nutrients, returning them to the environment for reuse by producers.

    Together, these groups define how energy enters ecosystems and how nutrients are recycled through living and nonliving components.

## Producers: The Entry Point of Energy into Ecosystems

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
[Producers]{.keyword}

-   organisms (plants, algae, and some bacteria)
-   manufacture the organic nutrients they need using energy and inorganic materials from their environment

[Photosynthesis]{.keyword}

-   Producers capture solar energy and use it

-   Convert carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O) into carbohydrates such as glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆), which store chemical energy

-   Oxygen (O₂) released as a byproduct of this process accumulates in the atmosphere, **making aerobic life possible** for most organisms
:::

## Consumers: Obtaining Energy from Other Organisms

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
[Consumers]{.keyword}

-   Cannot produce their own food
-   Obtain energy and nutrients by feeding on producers, other consumers, or the wastes and remains of organisms

Several major consumer types are commonly recognized:

-   [Primary consumers (herbivores)]{.keyword}: Animals that feed primarily on plants or algae
-   [Carnivores]{.keyword}: Animals that obtain energy by feeding on the tissues of other animals
:::

:::
:::::

## Decomposers: Recycling Matter in Ecosystems

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
[Decomposers]{.keyword} are consumers that obtain energy and nutrients by breaking down the wastes and remains of plants and animals.

They are a subset of **heterotrophs** and are primarily bacteria and fungi.

Through decomposition, these organisms convert organic matter into inorganic nutrients that are returned to the soil, water, and air, where they can be reused by producers.

:::
:::::

## Detritivores: Breaking Down Organic Matter

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
[Detritivores]{.keyword} obtain energy and nutrients by feeding directly on detritus—the wastes and dead bodies of other organisms.

By physically fragmenting organic material, detritivores help convert large, complex remains (such as fallen tree trunks) into simpler forms that can be further decomposed into inorganic nutrients usable by plants.

In natural ecosystems, wastes and dead organisms are not discarded; they function as resources that support nutrient cycling, consistent with the chemical cycling principle of sustainability.

:::
:::::

## Cellular Respiration: Releasing Stored Chemical Energy

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Producers, consumers, and decomposers all rely on [cellular respiration]{.keyword} to release the chemical energy stored in glucose and other organic compounds.

In most organisms, this occurs through **aerobic respiration**, which uses oxygen to convert glucose back into carbon dioxide and water, releasing energy that fuels growth, maintenance, and reproduction.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![Aerobic cellular respiration, showing glucose and oxygen being converted into carbon dioxide, water, and usable chemical energy. From Wikimedia Commons, a freely licensed media file repository.](images/respiration.png){fig-alt="Diagram illustrating aerobic respiration with glucose and oxygen as inputs and carbon dioxide, water, and ATP energy as outputs."}
:::
:::::

## Anaerobic Respiration: Energy without Oxygen

Some decomposers, including yeast and certain bacteria, obtain energy by breaking down glucose and other organic compounds **in the absence of oxygen**.

This process is known as [anaerobic respiration]{.keyword}, or **fermentation**.

Rather than producing carbon dioxide and water, anaerobic respiration generates a variety of end products, depending on the organism and pathway involved, including:

-   methane gas (CH₄)
-   ethyl alcohol (C₂H₆O)
-   acetic acid (C₂H₄O₂), the main component of vinegar
-   hydrogen sulfide (H₂S), a toxic gas with a characteristic rotten-egg odor

All organisms obtain energy through aerobic or anaerobic respiration, but **only producers (plants, algae, and some bacteria) carry out photosynthesis**.

## Energy Flow and Nutrient Cycling Sustain Ecosystems

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Ecosystems—and the biosphere as a whole—are sustained by two fundamental processes:

-   **One-way energy flow**: Energy enters ecosystems as sunlight, is captured by producers, transferred through trophic levels, and is ultimately lost as heat.
-   **Nutrient cycling**: Matter such as carbon, nitrogen, and water is continuously recycled between organisms and the physical environment.

Together, these processes reflect two core scientific principles of sustainability: energy flows through ecosystems, while nutrients cycle within them.

## Soil: The Foundation of Life on Land

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Soil is a complex, living system composed of:

-   rock fragments and mineral particles
-   essential mineral nutrients
-   decaying organic matter
-   water, air, and a diverse community of organisms

Soil is one of Earth’s most important forms of **natural capital**.

Although it is technically renewable, soil forms extremely slowly, making the protection and renewal of **topsoil** critical for long-term sustainability.

## Soil Profiles and Horizons

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Soils store organic carbon, helping regulate Earth’s climate
-   Soil structure is organized into horizontal layers called [horizons]{.keyword}
-   A vertical cross-section of these layers is a [soil profile]{.keyword}
-   **Major horizons in a mature soil:**
    -   **O** – organic layer (leaf litter)
    -   **A** – topsoil
    -   **B** – subsoil
    -   **C** – weathered parent material

## Ecologically Active Soil Layers

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Most plant roots and the majority of soil organic matter are concentrated in:
    -   the **O horizon** (leaf litter)
    -   the **A horizon** (topsoil)
-   These layers support dense communities of: bacteria, fungi, earthworms, insects and other soil invertebrates
-   Through feeding and decomposition, soil organisms:
    -   break down complex organic compounds
    -   produce [humus]{.keyword}, a stable mixture of partially decomposed plant and animal material
        -   Improves soil structure, nutrient availability, and water retention, supporting plant growth and ecosystem productivity.

## Soil Is the Foundation of Life on Land

-   In a fertile soil, these two layers teem with bacteria, fungi, earthworms, and numerous small insects, all interacting by feeding on and decomposing one another.

-   Break down soil's complex organic compounds into a mixture of the partially decomposed plant and animal remains, called \[humus\]{.keyword}

## What Happens to Energy in an Ecosystem?

-   Chemical energy stored as nutrients in the bodies and wastes of organisms.

-   Energy flows through ecosystems via movement between trophic levels through food chains and food webs.

-   The quality of energy available to organisms decreases as each successive trophic level is reached, because so much energy (heat) is lost moving from one level to the next.

## Energy Flows through Ecosystems in Food Chains and Food Webs

-   In natural ecosystems, most consumers feed on more than one type of organism, and most organisms are eaten or decomposed by more than one type of consumer.

-   Because of this, organisms in most ecosystems form a complex network of interconnected food chains called a \[food web\] {.keyword}**.**

-   Food chains and food webs show how producers, consumers, and decomposers are connected to one another as energy flows through trophic levels in an ecosystem.

## A Generalized Pyramid of Energy Flow

## Simplified Aquatic Food Web

-   This is a greatly simplified aquatic food web found in the southern hemisphere.

-   Many more participants in the web, including an array of decomposer and detritus feeder organisms, are not shown here.

## Some Ecosystems Produce Plant Matter Faster than Others Do

-   Scientists measure the rates at which ecosystems produce chemical energy to compare ecosystems and understand how they interact.

### GPP (gross primary productivity)

-   The rate that an ecosystem’s producers convert energy into biomass

-   To stay alive, grow, and reproduce, producers must use some of their stored chemical energy for their own aerobic respiration

### NPP (net primary productivity)

-   The rate that producers use photosynthesis to produce and store chemical energy minus the rate at which they use energy for aerobic respiration

## Some Ecosystems Produce Plant Matter Faster than Others Do

-   Terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems differ in their NPP (net primary productivity).

-   Despite low NPP, oceans produce most of the world’s biomass because of their vast size.

-   Tropical rainforests have high NPP—much is lost through natural capital degradation.

-   Only plant matter represented by NPP is available as nutrients for consumers.

## What Happens to Matter in an Ecosystem?

-   Matter in the form of nutrients and energy are naturally cycled and recycled through ecosystems and the biosphere.

    -   However, these chemical cycles are being altered by human activities.

-   Biogeochemical cycling, driven by incoming solar radiation and earth’s gravity continually, moves nutrients and energy through air, water, soils, rocks, and living organisms

    -   Supports the chemical cycling principle of sustainability

## The Water Cycle—Evaporation and Transpiration

-   The hydrologic cycle or water cycle collects, purifies, and distributes the earth’s fixed supply of water

    -   The cycle of natural water quality renewal

-   Incoming solar radiation moves water at the surface into the atmosphere through evaporation

    -   Mainly via transpiration (evaporation from the surface of plants)

## The Water Cycle—Precipitation and Surface Runoff

-   Condensation in the atmosphere and effects of gravity create precipitation, which returns water to the earth’s surface

    -   Surface runoff

    -   Aquifers and ground water

-   Only a very small portion of earth’s water is fresh water

    -   The rest is in oceans, stored as ice or is too deep to access

## How Do Humans Alter the Water Cycle?

-   By withdrawing freshwater resources faster than natural processes replenish it

-   By replacing forests & vegetation with urban development—reducing transpiration and increasing runoff

-   By draining and filling in wetlands, which disturbs the renewal abilities of the hydrologic cycle

## The Carbon Cycle

-   Atmospheric carbon dioxide, a key component of the carbon cycle, has a significant temperature effect (greenhouse effect)

-   How does carbon cycle through the biosphere?

-   Photosynthesis by producers

-   Aerobic respiration by producers, consumers, and decomposers

## How Do Humans Alter the Carbon Cycle?

-   By extracting and burning fossil fuels at a much higher rate than they are naturally formed

    -   This adds carbon dioxide to the atmosphere

-   By clearing forests faster than they regrow

    -   This destroys carbon-absorbing vegetation

## The Nitrogen Cycle: Bacteria in Action

-   How does nitrogen cycle through the biosphere?

-   Atmospheric nitrogen cannot be absorbed or used directly by most organisms.

-   Bacteria convert the nitrogen into a usable form, so it becomes a useful plant nutrient.

-   Consumers (herbivores) and decomposers convert the nitrogen back into nitrogen gas, which is then released into the atmosphere.

## Nitrogen fixing bacteria

-   Excreted to the aqueous phase as ammonia nitrogen.

-   [**Ammonia  (NH~4~)**]{.underline}is firstly oxidized to [**nitrite (NO~2~^-^)**]{.underline}by ammonia oxidizing bacteria and

-   Further converted to [**nitrate (NO~3~^-^)**]{.underline}by nitrite oxidizing bacteria, which are taken up and metabolized by plants.

-   Plants reduce nitrate back to [**ammonium (NH~4~^+^)**]{.underline}before incorporating the nitrogen into organic compounds

## How Do Humans Alter the Nitrogen Cycle?

-   By burning fossil fuels that adds nitric oxide to the atmosphere

    -   Nitrogen dioxide gas/nitric acid vapor causes acid rain

-   By removing atmospheric nitrogen to make fertilizer

    -   Agricultural runoff from fields into the water supply leads to algal overgrowth that disrupts the oxygen balance in aquatic systems

## Acid Rain

-   Occurs when Sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are emitted into the atmosphere, undergo chemical transformations and are absorbed by water droplets in clouds.

-   The droplets then fall to earth as rain, snow, mist, dry dust, hail, or sleet.

-   This can increase the acidity of the soil, and affect the chemical balance of lakes and streams

## Algal blooms

-   A relatively rapid increase in the population of (usually) phytoplankton algae in an aquatic system.

-   Causes the death of fish and disruption to the whole ecosystem of the lake.

-   International regulations has led to a reduction in the occurrences of these blooms.

## The Phosphorus Cycle

-   How does phosphorus cycle through the biosphere?

-   Cycles through soils, rocks, water, and plants but not through the atmosphere

-   Can be temporarily removed from natural cycling when washed into oceans and trapped in marine sediments

-   As with nitrogen, contributes to agricultural runoff

## How Do Humans Alter the Phosphorus Cycle?

-   By mining phosphorus deposits to make fertilizer

-   Through clearing of tropical forests, which reduces phosphorus in the topsoil

-   Through agricultural runoff and topsoil erosion, which disturbs biogeochemical cycling

## How Do Scientists Study Ecosystems?

-   Make direct observations and take measurements of ecosystems in the field (field research).

-   Fly over ecosystems to photograph them.

-   Carry out controlled experiments.

-   Use radio transmitters and remote sensing to track organisms.

-   Run mathematical models for issues that cannot be studied in the lab or field.

## Some Ecologists Use Laboratory Experiments or Modeling

-   How do scientists model ecosystems in the lab?

    -   With culture tubes, aquariums, and greenhouses and in indoor/outdoor chambers with controlled variables (light, temperature, etc.)

-   [**Pros:**]{.underline}small, controlled lab experiments save money and are faster to carry out

-   [**Con:**]{.underline}these experiments may not reflect reality well enough

## We Need to Learn More about the Health of the World’s Ecosystems

-   The 2005 ecosystem assessment shows that more baseline ecologic data is needed to:

    -   Evaluate the status of the world’s ecosystems

    -   Develop effective strategies for preventing and slowing ecosystem degradation

    -   Identify planetary boundaries that lead to irreversible changes if passed and help us to avoid reaching or passing them

## Ecosystems: Final Thoughts

-   Life is sustained by the flow of energy and nutrients through ecosystems, which are continually recycled.

-   Ecosystems are characterized by producers, consumers, and decomposers—all aid in the cycling process.

-   Human activities impact ecosystem cycling, sometimes negatively, sometimes positively

## Ecosystems: Final Thoughts

-   It would be easier if every ecosystems could be studied in a single cave.
