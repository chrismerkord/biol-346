## Perspective on What, Exactly?

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Ecological foundations**

-   Structure, function, and processes of [ecosystems]{.keyword}
-   Physical environment + biological communities (humans included)

**Human–environment interactions**

-   Environmental problems created by human activity
-   Societal dependence on natural systems
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Societal responses**

-   How social, legal, economic, political, cultural, and religious systems address [natural resource]{.keyword} challenges

**Sustainability**

-   What it is
-   Why it matters
-   How it is pursued
-   Ethical tradeoffs involved
:::
:::::

## Ethical Thinking

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Ethics** asks how we decide what is *right* and *wrong* conduct.

-   Everyday decisions are ethical decisions
-   Scientific and environmental decisions scale those choices up

**Example**

-   Would you park your car in this space?
-   Why—or why not?

## Bioethics

[**Bioethics**]{.keyword} - The study of ethical issues arising from advances in biology and medicine

Bioethics examines relationships among:

-   Life sciences
-   Biotechnology
-   Medicine
-   Politics and law
-   Philosophy

## Bioethics: Ordinary and Emerging Issues

Bioethics includes:

-   Everyday value-based decisions in medicine
-   The “ethics of the ordinary”

It also addresses **emerging biotechnologies** that affect:

-   Basic biology
-   Future humans

## Bioethics: Emerging Technologies

Examples include:

-   Cloning
-   Gene therapy
-   Human genetic engineering
-   Altered DNA and proteins
-   Life beyond Earth (astro-ethics)

These raise questions about:

-   What life is
-   What kinds of life should exist
-   Who gets to decide

## Biotic Ethics

Some ethical frameworks emphasize:

-   The intrinsic value of [life]{.keyword} itself
-   The responsibility to sustain and propagate life

These perspectives ask:

-   Do humans have obligations beyond our own species?
-   What responsibilities do we have to future life?

## Geoethics

[**Geoethics**]{.keyword}

-   Ethical thinking about human interactions with the Earth as a system

Includes scientific, technological, and social dimensions related to:

-   Sustainability and development
-   Geodiversity and geoheritage
-   Mineral and energy resource use
-   Natural hazard prediction and mitigation
-   Geoscience communication

## Why Ethics Matter in Science

Ethical concepts are essential for:

-   Any scientific study
-   Designing and implementing policies of change

Science tells us *what is possible* Ethics helps decide *what should be done*

## The Problem

In an ideal world:

-   Ethical principles would guide decisions
-   As scientific understanding increases, responsibility would increase

In reality:

-   Scientific capability often advances faster than ethical consensus

## Example: DDT and pesticide use

::::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
-   Synthetic pesticides were highly effective at controlling insect pests

-   Widely adopted before ecological consequences were understood

-   **Scientific capability** - Efficient, inexpensive, large-scale pest control

-   **Ethical and ecological failure**

-   Bioaccumulation in food webs

-   Severe impacts on birds and other wildlife

-   Long-term ecosystem damage

-   **Lesson** - Technical success ≠ ethical or ecological success

-   Sustainability requires anticipating system-wide and long-term effects
:::

:::
:::::

## Ethics and Sustainability: A Synthesis

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Ethics** provides a framework for deciding *what should be done*, not just *what can be done*

From an ecological perspective, ethics must integrate:

-   [Bioethics]{.keyword}: responsibilities to life and future organisms
-   [Geoethics]{.keyword}: responsibilities to Earth systems and resources
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Together, these inform:

-   Sustainable use of natural resources

-   Long-term human–environment relationships

-   Tradeoffs across space, time, and generations

**Sustainability is ultimately an ethical problem, not just a technical one**
:::
:::::

## Learning from the Earth

The Earth is a model of a long-term [sustainable system]{.keyword}.

-   Life has persisted for \~3.8 billion years
-   Biodiversity has survived major environmental change
-   Ecosystem processes recycle matter and energy efficiently

## What the Earth Teaches Us

Organisms persist by:

-   Acquiring energy efficiently
-   Minimizing waste
-   Functioning within physical and chemical limits

Many scientists argue:

-   Sustainability requires learning from *how natural systems work*

## Biomimicry

[**Biomimicry**]{.keyword} - Design approach that studies and imitates strategies used by living systems

Coined by biologist **Janine Benyus (1997)**

Core idea:

-   Nature is a model, measure, and mentor for sustainable solutions

## Biomimicry: A Concrete Example

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Gecko adhesion**

-   Gecko toes are covered with microscopic hairs called [setae]{.keyword}
-   Each seta branches into hundreds of smaller structures called [spatulae]{.keyword}
-   Branching increases contact area with surfaces
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/clipboard-3602311104.png)

![](images/clipboard-1940733998.png)
:::
:::::

## The Physical Mechanism

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Spatulae get extremely close to surfaces
-   This allows [van der Waals forces]{.keyword} to operate

Result:

-   Weak forces at the molecular level add up

-   Enables strong, reversible adhesion without glue
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/clipboard-3815716397.png)
:::
:::::

## Why This Matters for Sustainability

Geckos demonstrate:

-   High performance without toxic chemicals
-   Reversible attachment with minimal energy cost
-   Functioning through structure, not consumption

**Biomimicry asks:**

-   How can human technologies work *with* physical laws instead of against them?

## Sustainability: Big Picture

Life on Earth has persisted for billions of years.

-   Sustained by solar energy
-   Maintained through biodiversity
-   Stabilized by chemical (nutrient) cycling

**Core idea** - Long-term persistence is possible when systems operate within limits

## Environmental Science

**Environmental science** studies: - Interactions between humans and the natural world

[**Environment**]{.keyword} - Everything around us, living and nonliving

[**Ecosystem**]{.keyword} - Organisms in a defined area interacting with each other and their environment

## Environmentalism

[**Environmentalism**]{.keyword} - A social movement focused on sustaining Earth’s life-support systems

Distinction:

-   Environmental science → understanding
-   Environmentalism → action

## Goals of Environmental Science

Environmental science aims to:

-   Understand how life on Earth has persisted
-   Understand human–environment interactions
-   Identify ways to address environmental problems
-   Support more sustainable living

## Three Scientific Principles of Sustainability

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Life on Earth is sustained by:

[**Dependence on solar energy**]{.keyword} - Drives climate, photosynthesis, and food webs

[**Biodiversity**]{.keyword} - Provides ecosystem services and resilience

[**Chemical (nutrient) cycling**]{.keyword} - Waste in one process becomes a resource in another
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/clipboard-395409669.png)
:::
:::::

## A Core Ecological Insight

**Interdependence, not independence, sustains life**

-   Organisms depend on ecosystems
-   Ecosystems depend on energy flow and material cycling
-   Humans are part of—not separate from—these systems

## Natural Capital

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
[**Natural capital**]{.keyword}

-   Natural resources
-   Ecosystem services provided by healthy systems

Examples:

-   Clean air and water
-   Pollination
-   Climate regulation
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![Neill et al. A Natural Capital Lens for a Sustainable Bioeconomy: Determining the Unrealised and Unrecognised Services from Nature(2020) Sustainability, 12(19), 8033 – 8057.](images/clipboard-2865605124.png)
:::
:::::

## Degrading Natural Capital

Humans degrade natural capital by:

-   Using renewable resources faster than they can regenerate
-   Overloading ecosystems with pollution and waste

Result:

-   Loss of ecosystem services
-   Reduced system resilience

## What Is a Resource?

[**Natural resources**]{.keyword}

-   Useful materials and energy from nature

Resources may be:

-   Readily available
-   Dependent on technology for extraction or use

## Types of Resources

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
[**Inexhaustible resources**]{.keyword}

-   Perpetually available (e.g., solar energy)

[**Renewable resources**]{.keyword}

-   Replenished within their sustainable yield

[**Nonrenewable resources**]{.keyword}

-   Fixed quantities renewed only through long-term geologic processes
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/clipboard-2199864411.png)
:::
:::::

## Sustainable Resource Use

Sustainable solutions prioritize:

-   Refuse
-   Reduce
-   Reuse
-   Recycle

Goal: - Lower demand before increasing supply

## Social Dimensions of Sustainability

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Key ideas from the social sciences:

-   Ecosystem services are free benefits from nature

-   Economies depend on healthy ecosystems

-   Sustainability requires slowing resource use to match replacement rates
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/clipboard-3191330339.png)
:::
:::::

## Sustainability Solutions

Effective solutions:

-   Cross disciplines (science, economics, politics)

-   Involve trade-offs and compromises

-   Can be encouraged through policy and subsidies

-   Depend on individual and local actions

## Global Inequality in Resource Use

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Countries differ in environmental impact:

**Industrialized countries**

-   \~17% of global population
-   Disproportionately high resource use

**Developing countries**

-   \~83% of global population
-   Middle-income and low-income nations

## How Are We Affecting the Earth?

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Over time, growth of ecological footprints depletes and degrades earth’s natural capital (natural resources and ecosystem services)

Environmental degradation

Humans have the power to sustain, add to, or degrade natural capital

-   A set of beliefs about what is right and wrong in your behavior toward the environment
:::
:::::

## People Have Different Views About Environmental Problems/Solutions

Three major types of worldviews:

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Human-centered**

    -   Sees the natural world primarily as a support system for human life.

    -   Humans are separate from and in charge of nature and that society should manage the earth for the benefit of humans.

-   **Life-centered**

    -   All species have value in fulfilling their ecological roles, regardless of their potential or actual use to society
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Earth-centered**

    -   People are part of and dependent on nature, and the earth's natural capital exists for all species, not just for humans

## The Rise of Environmental Conservation and Protection in the United States

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
The **preservationist** school (John Muir)

-   Leave wilderness areas on some public lands untouched

## What Is an Environmentally Sustainable Society?

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   In order to live sustainably, one must live off the natural resources without depleting or degrading the natural capital that supplies these natural resources

-   Earth’s natural capital provides natural income

    -   Renewable resources such as plants, animals, soil, and clean water and air

-   By living only on the natural income and not depleting the natural capital, society moves from an unsustainable lifestyle to a sustainable one
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](images/clipboard-592918422.png)
:::
:::::

## Is There Any Good News?

Many have a better quality of life. The food supply is more abundant and safer.

-   In many parts of the world, air and water are cleaner.

-   Toxic chemical exposure is more avoidable.

-   Endangered species and ecosystems are protected.

-   Some grasslands and wetlands are restored.

## A More Sustainable Future Is Possible

Given enough time, most degraded environments can recover, but many will take hundreds and even thousands of years to recover

-   Time is our most scarce resource

-   However, 5–10% of a population that changes can make a difference

-   Changes can occur in a shorter time than previously thought

## A More Sustainable Future Is Possible

-   **Create a more sustainable future.** Use natural capital and natural resources. Avoid disruption of the earth’s chemical cycles.

-   **Utilize full-cost pricing.** Be aware of ecological footprints, and address cleanup and prevention.

-   **Find win-win solutions.** Apply these solutions to other societies. Leave the planet in the same or better condition than we inherit.

## Key Takeaway

Sustainability is not a single problem or solution.

-   It integrates ecology, resources, and society
-   It depends on understanding limits
-   It requires choices at individual, national, and global scales
