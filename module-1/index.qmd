## Perspective on What, Exactly?

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Ecological foundations** 

- Structure, function, and processes of [ecosystems]{.keyword} 
- Physical environment + biological communities (humans included)

**Human–environment interactions** 

- Environmental problems created by human activity 
- Societal dependence on natural systems
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Societal responses** 

- How social, legal, economic, political, cultural, and religious systems address [natural resource]{.keyword} challenges

**Sustainability** 

- What it is 
- Why it matters 
- How it is pursued 
- Ethical tradeoffs involved
:::
:::::

## Ethical Thinking

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Ethics** asks how we decide what is *right* and *wrong* conduct.

-   Everyday decisions are ethical decisions
-   Scientific and environmental decisions scale those choices up

**Example** 

- Would you park your car in this space? 
- Why—or why not?

## Bioethics

[**Bioethics**]{.keyword} - The study of ethical issues arising from advances in biology and medicine

Bioethics examines relationships among: 

- Life sciences 
- Biotechnology 
- Medicine 
- Politics and law 
- Philosophy

## Bioethics: Ordinary and Emerging Issues

Bioethics includes:

- Everyday value-based decisions in medicine
- The “ethics of the ordinary”

It also addresses **emerging biotechnologies** that affect: 

- Basic biology 
- Future humans

## Bioethics: Emerging Technologies

Examples include: 

- Cloning 
- Gene therapy 
- Human genetic engineering 
- Altered DNA and proteins 
- Life beyond Earth (astro-ethics)

These raise questions about: 

- What life is 
- What kinds of life should exist 
- Who gets to decide

## Biotic Ethics

Some ethical frameworks emphasize: 

- The intrinsic value of [life]{.keyword} itself 
- The responsibility to sustain and propagate life

These perspectives ask: 

- Do humans have obligations beyond our own species? 
- What responsibilities do we have to future life?

## Geoethics

[**Geoethics**]{.keyword} 

- Ethical thinking about human interactions with the Earth as a system

Includes scientific, technological, and social dimensions related to: 

- Sustainability and development 
- Geodiversity and geoheritage 
- Mineral and energy resource use 
- Natural hazard prediction and mitigation 
- Geoscience communication

## Why Ethics Matter in Science

Ethical concepts are essential for: 

- Any scientific study 
- Designing and implementing policies of change

Science tells us *what is possible*
Ethics helps decide *what should be done*

## The Problem

In an ideal world: 

- Ethical principles would guide decisions 
- As scientific understanding increases, responsibility would increase

In reality: 

- Scientific capability often advances faster than ethical consensus

## Example: DDT and pesticide use

::::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
-   Synthetic pesticides were highly effective at controlling insect pests

-   Widely adopted before ecological consequences were understood

-   **Scientific capability** - Efficient, inexpensive, large-scale pest control

-   **Ethical and ecological failure** 

- Bioaccumulation in food webs 
- Severe impacts on birds and other wildlife 
- Long-term ecosystem damage

-   **Lesson** - Technical success ≠ ethical or ecological success

  -   Sustainability requires anticipating system-wide and long-term effects

## Ethics and Sustainability: A Synthesis

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Ethics** provides a framework for deciding *what should be done*, not just *what can be done*

From an ecological perspective, ethics must integrate:

-   [Bioethics]{.keyword}: responsibilities to life and future organisms
-   [Geoethics]{.keyword}: responsibilities to Earth systems and resources
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Together, these inform:

-   Sustainable use of natural resources

-   Long-term human–environment relationships

-   Tradeoffs across space, time, and generations

**Sustainability is ultimately an ethical problem, not just a technical one**
:::
:::::

## Learning from the Earth

The Earth is a model of a long-term [sustainable system]{.keyword}.

-   Life has persisted for \~3.8 billion years
-   Biodiversity has survived major environmental change
-   Ecosystem processes recycle matter and energy efficiently

## What the Earth Teaches Us

Organisms persist by: 

- Acquiring energy efficiently 
- Minimizing waste 
- Functioning within physical and chemical limits

Many scientists argue: 

- Sustainability requires learning from *how natural systems work*

## Biomimicry

[**Biomimicry**]{.keyword} - Design approach that studies and imitates strategies used by living systems

Coined by biologist **Janine Benyus (1997)**

Core idea: 

- Nature is a model, measure, and mentor for sustainable solutions

## Biomimicry: A Concrete Example

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Gecko adhesion**

-   Gecko toes are covered with microscopic hairs called [setae]{.keyword}
-   Each seta branches into hundreds of smaller structures called [spatulae]{.keyword}
-   Branching increases contact area with surfaces
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

![](images/clipboard-1940733998.png)
:::
:::::

## The Physical Mechanism

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Spatulae get extremely close to surfaces
-   This allows [van der Waals forces]{.keyword} to operate

Result:

-   Weak forces at the molecular level add up

-   Enables strong, reversible adhesion without glue
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/clipboard-3815716397.png)
:::
:::::

## Why This Matters for Sustainability

Geckos demonstrate: 

- High performance without toxic chemicals 
- Reversible attachment with minimal energy cost 
- Functioning through structure, not consumption

**Biomimicry asks:** 

- How can human technologies work *with* physical laws instead of against them?

## Sustainability: Big Picture

Life on Earth has persisted for billions of years.

-   Sustained by solar energy
-   Maintained through biodiversity
-   Stabilized by chemical (nutrient) cycling

**Core idea** - Long-term persistence is possible when systems operate within limits

## Environmental Science

**Environmental science** studies: - Interactions between humans and the natural world

[**Environment**]{.keyword} - Everything around us, living and nonliving

[**Ecosystem**]{.keyword} - Organisms in a defined area interacting with each other and their environment

## Environmentalism

[**Environmentalism**]{.keyword} - A social movement focused on sustaining Earth’s life-support systems

Distinction: 

- Environmental science → understanding 
- Environmentalism → action

## Goals of Environmental Science

Environmental science aims to: 

- Understand how life on Earth has persisted 
- Understand human–environment interactions 
- Identify ways to address environmental problems 
- Support more sustainable living

## Three Scientific Principles of Sustainability

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Life on Earth is sustained by:

[**Dependence on solar energy**]{.keyword} - Drives climate, photosynthesis, and food webs

[**Biodiversity**]{.keyword} - Provides ecosystem services and resilience

[**Chemical (nutrient) cycling**]{.keyword} - Waste in one process becomes a resource in another

## A Core Ecological Insight

**Interdependence, not independence, sustains life**

-   Organisms depend on ecosystems
-   Ecosystems depend on energy flow and material cycling
-   Humans are part of—not separate from—these systems

## Natural Capital

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
[**Natural capital**]{.keyword} 

- Natural resources 
- Ecosystem services provided by healthy systems

Examples: 

- Clean air and water 
- Pollination 
- Climate regulation
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![Neill et al. A Natural Capital Lens for a Sustainable Bioeconomy: Determining the Unrealised and Unrecognised Services from Nature(2020) Sustainability, 12(19), 8033 – 8057.](images/clipboard-2865605124.png)
:::
:::::

## Degrading Natural Capital

Humans degrade natural capital by: 

- Using renewable resources faster than they can regenerate 
- Overloading ecosystems with pollution and waste

Result: 

- Loss of ecosystem services 
- Reduced system resilience

## What Is a Resource?

[**Natural resources**]{.keyword} 

- Useful materials and energy from nature

Resources may be: 

- Readily available 
- Dependent on technology for extraction or use

## Types of Resources

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
[**Inexhaustible resources**]{.keyword} 

- Perpetually available (e.g., solar energy)

[**Renewable resources**]{.keyword} 

- Replenished within their sustainable yield

[**Nonrenewable resources**]{.keyword} 

- Fixed quantities renewed only through long-term geologic processes
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/clipboard-2199864411.png)

:::::

## Sustainable Resource Use

Sustainable solutions prioritize: 

- Refuse 
- Reduce 
- Reuse 
- Recycle

Goal: - Lower demand before increasing supply

## Social Dimensions of Sustainability

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Key ideas from the social sciences:

- Ecosystem services are free benefits from nature

- Economies depend on healthy ecosystems

- Sustainability requires slowing resource use to match replacement rates
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/clipboard-3191330339.png)

:::::

## Sustainability Solutions

Effective solutions:

-   Cross disciplines (science, economics, politics)

-   Involve trade-offs and compromises

-   Can be encouraged through policy and subsidies

-   Depend on individual and local actions

## Global Inequality in Resource Use

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Countries differ in environmental impact:

**Industrialized countries** 

- \~17% of global population 
- Disproportionately high resource use

**Developing countries** 

- \~83% of global population 
- Middle-income and low-income nations

## Key Takeaway

Sustainability is not a single problem or solution.

-   It integrates ecology, resources, and society
-   It depends on understanding limits
-   It requires choices at individual, national, and global scales
