## The Scientific Process (Simplified)

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Observation
-   Question
-   Hypothesis
-   Prediction
-   Test / experiment
-   Analyze results
-   Revise or repeat
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/scientific-process.png){width="456"}
:::
:::::

## Hypotheses

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Tentative explanations
-   Testable and falsifiable
-   Based on observations
-   Supported or rejected by data
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/clipboard-2013537225.png)
:::
:::::

## Scientific Theories

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Broad explanations of natural phenomena
-   Supported by extensive evidence
-   Repeatedly tested
-   Widely accepted by scientists
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/clipboard-3417289828.png)
:::
:::::

## Scientific Laws

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   A description of a consistent pattern in nature
-   Often expressed mathematically
-   Describes **what happens**, not **why it happens**
-   Highly reliable and repeatable
-   Revised only with new evidence
-   Laws are **not “proven theories”**
-   Theories do not graduate into laws
-   They answer different questions:
    -   Laws: *What happens?*
    -   Theories: *Why and how does it happen?*
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Classic examples:

-   Newton’s laws of motion
-   Laws of thermodynamics
-   Law of conservation of matter
    -   Matter is neither created nor destroyed in physical or chemical changes
    -   Atoms are rearranged, but the total amount of matter remains constant

## Hypotheses vs. Theories vs. Laws

-   Hypothesis: tentative, testable idea
-   Theory: well-supported explanation
-   Law: consistent description of behavior
-   Different roles, not levels of certainty

## Evaluating Scientific Knowledge

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Peer review**\
    Independent evaluation by other scientists in the field

-   **Replication of results**\
    Findings can be reproduced using the same methods

-   **Transparent methods**\
    Clear description of data, methods, and analyses

-   **Strength of evidence**\
    Multiple lines of evidence support the same conclusion

:::::

## Limits of Science

-   **No absolute proof**\
    Scientific conclusions are always open to revision

-   **Measurement uncertainty**\
    Observations and measurements contain inherent error

-   **Potential for bias**\
    Scientists are human and can be influenced by assumptions

-   **Peer review reduces bias**\
    Independent review helps identify errors and bias

## What Is Matter and What Happens When It Undergoes Change?

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space
-   Composed of atoms, ions, and molecules
-   Forms elements and compounds
-   Exists in three physical states: solid, liquid, or gas
-   Matter is rearranged during physical and chemical changes
-   Cannot be created or destroyed (law of conservation of matter)

## Matter Consists of Elements and Compounds

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   [Elements]{.keyword}\
    Substances made of one type of atom
-   [Compounds]{.keyword}\
    Combinations of two or more different elements
-   Elements cannot be chemically broken down
-   Represented by chemical symbols (e.g., H, O, C)

## An Atom Is the Basic Building Block of Matter

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Smallest unit of an element that retains its chemical properties
-   Composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons
-   Protons and neutrons form the nucleus
-   Electrons occupy regions surrounding the nucleus

## Atomic Number, Atomic Mass, and Element

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Atoms differ in numbers of subatomic particles

-   Atomic number determines the element

    -   Number of protons in the atomic nucleus

-   Mass number

    -   Total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an element’s atoms

-   Element

    -   A pure substance that consists only of atoms with the same number of protons

## Why Electrons Matter (shell model)

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Electrons occupy energy levels (shells) around the nucleus
-   Outer-shell electrons determine how atoms interact
-   Atoms with incomplete outer shells are chemically reactive
-   Atoms gain, lose, or share electrons to become more stable
-   Chemical reactivity controls nutrient availability, toxicity, and pollutant behavior in the environment

:::::

## Ions

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Atoms with a net electric charge

-   Formed when atoms gain or lose electrons

-   Loss of electrons → positively charged ion (cation)

-   Gain of electrons → negatively charged ion (anion)

-   Ionic form affects solubility, mobility, and biological availability in the environment
