::: {.column width="50%"}
-   A description of a consistent pattern in nature
-   Often expressed mathematically
-   Describes **what happens**, not **why it happens**
-   Highly reliable and repeatable
-   Revised only with new evidence
-   Laws are **not “proven theories”**
-   Theories do not graduate into laws
-   They answer different questions:
    -   Laws: *What happens?*
    -   Theories: *Why and how does it happen?*
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Classic examples:

-   Newton’s laws of motion
-   Laws of thermodynamics
-   Law of conservation of matter
    -   Matter is neither created nor destroyed in physical or chemical changes
    -   Atoms are rearranged, but the total amount of matter remains constant

:::::

## Hypotheses vs. Theories vs. Laws

-   Hypothesis: tentative, testable idea

    Observations and measurements contain inherent error

-   **Potential for bias**\
    Scientists are human and can be influenced by assumptions

-   **Peer review reduces bias**\
    Independent review helps identify errors and bias

## So, why care about ions and compounds?

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   So, understanding the chemistry of ions and compounds allows us to measure them.

Remember the trees in the valley?

-   Scientists learned how to measure nitrate and nitrite ions in water to determine the concentration of these ions

    -   Reduce nitrate with zinc and react with naphthylethylenediamine under acid conditions to produce a red compound - 550mn.

-   Determined that lack of trees washed out nitrates from the soil, increasing in concentration in the water runoff.

## A pH Scale

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   To describe the acidity of a solution, we use the pH scale.

-   Bases have a high pH, so they have a low concentration of H+
